# Overview

CelinQL is an Excel add-ins for extracting data from Oracle E1 using AIS.

The main feature is a SQL-like tool (referred to as `cql`) for querying E1/JDE tables, business views and forms.

The results can be pasted onto a sheet, inserted/appended to a table or `spilled` with custom functions.
