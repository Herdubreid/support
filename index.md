# Overview

CelinXL is an Excel add-ins for extracting data and submitting form request to Oracle E1 using AIS.

The data extraction tool has SQL-like syntax (referred to as `cql`) for querying E1/JDE tables, business views and forms.

The results can be pasted onto a sheet, inserted/appended to a table or `spilled` with custom functions.

The form request tool (referred to as `csl`) uses a chained list of commands for most common form actions.
